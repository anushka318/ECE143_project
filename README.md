# Problem:
This project analyzes student anxiety data to reveal underlying patterns and key triggers.


# Dataset:
Kaggle open dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/petalme/student-anxiety-dataset)
The entire dataset consists of 1csv file containing various information related to student anxiety, including factors contributing to anxiety, its manifestations, and potential mitigating influences. Through this dataset, we can gain deep insights into students' mental health, stress levels, academic pressures, coping strategies, and other related attributes.
Proposed Solution and Real-World Application:
Our proposed solution focuses on utilizing data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to study student anxiety, structuring the project into two main phases: data cleaning and data analysis with visualization. The primary objective is to develop interactive visualizations and dashboards that highlight patterns, trends, and correlations, such as common anxiety triggers and the effectiveness of various coping strategies. The real-world applications of this project include early intervention, where educators and mental health professionals can leverage these insights to identify high-risk students and implement timely support measures; policy-making, which involves analyzing key contributing factors to student anxiety to inform and refine school policies and mental health programs; and resource allocation, ensuring that mental health resources and support systems are distributed optimally based on data-driven insights.
